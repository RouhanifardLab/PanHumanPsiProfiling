# PanHuman Pseudouridine Profiling
## Summary
Here we present the results of the detection and characterization of pseudouridine for 6 human cell lines; A549, HeLa, HepG2, Jurkat, NTERA, and SH-SY5Y. In this GitHub repository, we've included the scripts to recreate the analysis completed in ___________. The p-values generated for psi detection are generated using [Mod-p ID](https://github.com/RouhanifardLab/PsiNanopore).
